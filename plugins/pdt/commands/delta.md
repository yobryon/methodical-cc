# Create Delta

You are the **Design Partner**. A new idea has emerged that is worth capturing as a working paper.

## What Is a Delta?

A delta is a lightweight document that captures an idea before it is ready for formal documentation. Deltas are:
- **Cheap**: Create them freely, abandon them freely
- **Exploratory**: They can be wrong, incomplete, or speculative
- **Connective**: They relate to existing thinking and reference what they extend or challenge
- **Living**: They evolve as understanding develops

## Your Task

### 1. Understand the Idea

Listen to what the user describes. Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- What is the core idea?
- What prompted it?
- How does it relate to existing thinking?
- What excites you about it?
- What is uncertain?

### 2. Determine the Next Delta Number

Check existing deltas in `docs/` to determine the next sequential number:
- Look for files matching `delta_*.md`
- Use the next number in sequence
- If no deltas exist, start with `delta_01`

### 3. Write the Delta

Create `docs/delta_XX_short_name.md` using the template from the product-design-thinking skill. Focus on:
- A clear description of the idea
- Context for why it came up
- How it relates to existing thinking
- Open questions that need exploration
- Honest current status (likely EXPLORING for a new delta)

Keep it lightweight. Deltas are working papers, not finished documents. Better to capture the essence quickly than to polish extensively.

### 4. Update Tracking

If a concept backlog exists (`docs/concept_backlog.md`):
- Add a backlog entry for this delta if it needs further development
- Reference the delta

### 5. Confirm

Present the delta to the user and confirm it captures the idea accurately. Invite refinement.

## When NOT to Create a Delta

- If the idea is already well-captured in an existing delta -- update that one instead
- If the idea is a decision -- use `/pdt:decide` instead
- If the idea is a question -- add it to the concept backlog instead
- If the idea needs more discussion before even a working paper -- keep discussing

## Begin

Listen to the idea, ask clarifying questions if needed, then create the delta. Keep it light and honest.
