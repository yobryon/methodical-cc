# Reading Guide

**Project:** [Project Name]
**Created:** [Date]
**Prepared by:** Design Partner

This guide inventories and classifies all existing materials relevant to the product design effort. It establishes the landscape of existing thinking and prioritizes what needs deep reading.

## Materials Inventory

### Priority 1: Must Read (Core Understanding)

| # | Material | Type | Location | Notes |
|---|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | [Title/Description] | [Vision doc / Design doc / Research / Notes / etc.] | [File path or URL] | [Why this is priority 1] |

### Priority 2: Should Read (Important Context)

| # | Material | Type | Location | Notes |
|---|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | [Title/Description] | [Type] | [Location] | [What this contributes] |

### Priority 3: Reference (Consult As Needed)

| # | Material | Type | Location | Notes |
|---|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | [Title/Description] | [Type] | [Location] | [When this becomes relevant] |
