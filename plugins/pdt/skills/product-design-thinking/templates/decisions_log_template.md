# Decisions Log

**Project:** [Project Name]

This log records all resolved design decisions with their context and rationale. It serves as institutional memory -- the record of why things are the way they are.

## How to Read This Log

Each decision includes:
- **Context**: What prompted the decision
- **Options Considered**: What alternatives were weighed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
- **Implications**: What follows from this decision

Decisions are numbered sequentially (DEC-01, DEC-02, etc.) and are never deleted. If a decision is later reversed, a new decision is recorded that supersedes the original, with a reference.
