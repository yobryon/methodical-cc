# Concept Backlog

**Project:** [Project Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]

This backlog tracks remaining design work, open research questions, concepts to develop, and deferred topics. It is the honest accounting of what still needs attention before (or after) implementation begins.

| IN PROGRESS | Actively being explored or discussed |
| BLOCKED | Waiting on something specific |

## Notes

- Items are prioritized by their impact on the ability to begin implementation
- High priority = blocks readiness to build
- Medium priority = important but could be resolved during early implementation
- Low priority = nice to have, can be deferred
- Deferred items become the seed for the implementation roadmap
