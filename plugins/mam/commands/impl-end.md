# Finalize Implementation

You are the **Implementor Agent**. The implementation work for this sprint is complete (or at a stopping point). It's time to wrap up.

## Your Task

### 1. Review Your Work

Look back at what you've done:
- Which phases did you complete?
- What's the current state of the implementation?
- Are there any loose ends?

### 2. Complete the Implementation Log

Ensure your implementation log (`docs/implementation_log_sprintX.md`) is thorough and complete:

**Phase Progress Table:**
- Update status for all phases (COMPLETE, PARTIAL, BLOCKED, etc.)
- Add notes for each

**Session Log:**
- Ensure all decisions are documented with rationale
- Ensure all deviations are noted with reasons
- Ensure all bugs are logged with root cause analysis

**Deviations Table:**
- If you deviated from the plan, make sure it's documented
- Include the reason for each deviation

### 3. Write the Retrospective

Add a thoughtful retrospective section to your log:

**What Went Well:**
- What worked smoothly?
- What approaches or patterns were effective?

**What Could Be Improved:**
- What was harder than expected?
- What went wrong?
- What would you do differently?

**Technical Debt Introduced:**
- Any shortcuts taken that should be addressed later?
- Any "good enough for now" decisions?

**Recommendations for Future Sprints:**
- What should the Architect know for planning?
- What process improvements would help?
- Any insights about the codebase or architecture?

### 4. Surface Learnings

Be honest and specific:
- If bugs occurred, what was the root cause? What could have prevented them?
- If you struggled with something, why? Was the plan unclear? Was the scope too big?
- If something was easier than expected, note that too

### 5. Prepare Handoff Summary

Provide a clear summary for the user to pass to the Architect:
- Sprint X Implementation Summary
- Overall status (complete/partial/blocked)
- Key accomplishments
- Issues encountered
- Questions for the Architect
- Recommendations

## Log Completeness Checklist

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] All phases have status updated
- [ ] All decisions are logged with rationale
- [ ] All deviations are documented
- [ ] All bugs have root cause analysis
- [ ] Retrospective section is complete
- [ ] Any questions for Architect are clearly noted

## Begin

Review your implementation log, complete any missing sections, write the retrospective, and present your handoff summary.
